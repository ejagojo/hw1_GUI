GUI Assignment: This GUI assigment is a way for us students to portray/practice
the web development skills we are able to learn with the provided learning resources
in the hw1 document provided.

Some of the functionality I wanted to implement was am interative navbar that had
abit of animation, but my website consists of a "about me page" and a navbar tab that 
has similar linkTree functionality. And for the styling of the pictures, I included
a border and a slight zoom in animation when hovering.

        <p>
            My name is Eljohn Agojo, and I am currently a senior attending the University of Massachusetts Lowell, studying Computer Science.
            I have had my fair share of coding experiences as a student. More specifically, I just finished my co-op at Wayfair!
            Although it wasn't fully focused on Frontend development, I was able to sharpen my skills in JavaScript, Python, and PowerShell scripting. To be more relevant, 
            I am currently doing some freelance work as a frontend developer for a small "startup" called StarterKitz, the tech stack used is ReactJS, Google Firebase, and Railway for deployment.
            Though I wish I could call myself a Fullstack Developer, I must say my backend knowledge needs a lot of work.
            Enough of that, I am more than just your regular tech student. I love to play video games, travel, eat food from different cultures
            and lift! As a matter of fact, I am actually a powerlifter and my goal is to one day be able to bench 315lbs, squat 500lbs, and deadlift 550lbs.
